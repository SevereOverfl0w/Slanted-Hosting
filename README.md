# Setting up the site
---
### Dependancies

To run the site you will need to have the latest versioni of Sass, NodeJS, and grunt-cli.

---
### Starting the website
Starting the website is as simple as running the following commands:

First install our node modules
> npm install

Next install our bower components
> bower install (--allow-root may be needed)

Lastly lets run grunt to package everything up

> grunt

That's it, you will need to run this on a web server, if you'd like to run it on localhost easily you can simply run the following in the CWD of the website

> python -m SimpleHTTPServer

then navigate to

> http://localhost:8000

Enjoy!
